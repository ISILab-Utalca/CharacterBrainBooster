NameSuffix.Extension

Ej:

DecisionView.uxml
EditorWindow.cs

Meaning of suffixes:

Window: The elements marked as "Windows" represent a context and must be
used to contain other elements, these are concrete and specific.

Panel: Elements marked as "Panel" represent more specific containers,
they should try to have more generic behavior but are not limited to this rule.

View: The elements marked as "view" represent the visual part of something,
these elements should only refer to that something and should be as specific as possible.

no Suffix: the elements that are not marked with suffixes correspond to
simple and generic elements that must be used by other elements, it seeks to encourage code reuse.

Rules:

All files that refer to the same type of element must have the same name and only differ by their extension.
